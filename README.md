Metrology project 3TC

Static measures : autoTraceroute.sh and mapCreater.py were used to generate map.html (same map as in the report). 

Dyamic measures : test_debit.sh and throughput.p were used to generate the plot in the report. In the data section, only data.dat was used for the dynamic measures.
